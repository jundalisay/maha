Maharlika had names for major deities like:
- Bathala of the Tagalogs
- Kabunian of the Ifugao
- Makaptan of the Bisaya

We unify these with a subtler name as Abba.

This leads to the phrase "Aba!" which means "Oh God!"

This is proven in local prayers such as "Aba Ginoong Maria".

More commonly, it means "Oh!" or "Hey!"



<!-- 

*   **Folk Catholicism as a Preserver:** In many traditional *pabasa* (chanting of the Passion) and folk prayers, the triplet **"Aba! Aba! Aba!"** is used as a solemn refrain, a cry of lamentation or supplication. This structure mirrors other sacred triplets in global religions (like "Holy, Holy, Holy" or "Santo, Santo, Santo"), suggesting it is more than mere filler—it is a **liturgical fossil**.

*   **The Shift to Bathala:** Spanish chroniclers like Plasencia recorded **"Bathala"** as the most common name for the supreme god among the Tagalogs. Scholars like **Jean-Paul Potet** and **F. Landa Jocano** posit that "Bathala" (from Sanskrit *Batara Guru*, meaning "Noble Lord") may have been a later, formal title that overlapped with or eventually supplanted a more ancient, indigenous name: **Abba**.
*   **The "Abba" Hypothesis:** The theory suggests that **Abba** was an ancient, possibly primal, name for a creator or sky god. Its use in direct address ("Oh, Abba!") gradually shortened into the standalone exclamation "Aba!" used in daily life, while the full name was retained in solemn ritual cries.

### **Abba in the Wider Austronesian World**

The evidence for "Abba" extends beyond the Philippines, tracing a path across the Austronesian diaspora.

*   **Central Luzon:** Among the **Ibaloi** and other Cordillera peoples, **"Kabunian"** is the supreme deity. Linguistically, this is argued to derive from ***"Ka-Abunian,"*** with the root ***"Abun"*** or ***"Apun"*** meaning "ancestor" or "lord." This root bears a striking resemblance to "Abba."
*   **The Pacific:** This connection explodes across the ocean. In **Hawaiian**, *"Akua"* means god. In **Māori** (New Zealand), *"Atua"* means god. In **Tagalog**, the word for "ancestor" is ***"apun"*** or ***"upun"*** (as in *ninuno*).
*   **The Proto-Austronesian Root:** Linguists reconstruct the proto-form ***qa(n)dCua** or similar, evolving into the widespread *atua/akua* pattern. The Philippine "Abba" and the Polynesian "Atua" likely share a common, ancient ancestral word for a divine, ancestral spirit.

### **A Stunning Link to Ancient Semitic Language**

The most captivating parallel lies far to the west. In **Aramaic**, the language spoken by Jesus of Nazareth, the word for "Father" is **"Abba"** (אבא). It was an intimate, familial term for God, translated as "Papa" or "Dearest Father."

This is likely a case of **astonishing coincidence rather than direct contact**—a powerful example of how distant cultures can arrive at similar sacred syllables. However, some scholars have speculated about very ancient, pre-historic connections between Austronesian and Afro-Asiatic language families, or the universal tendency for "baby talk" syllables (like *ab/ba, pa/pa, ma/ma*) to form the basis of words for primary caregivers and, by extension, creator figures. Whether by profound coincidence or a deep, forgotten thread in human history, the divine **"Abba"** resonates from the Lord's Prayer in Jerusalem to the ritual cries of pre-colonial Luzon.

### **Conclusion: A Ghost in the Language**

The case for **"Abba"** as a pre-colonial deity is not one of stone idols or written scriptures, but of **ghosts in the language**. It is built on:
1.  The ritual use of **"Aba! Aba! Aba!"** as a divine cry.
2.  Its linguistic kinship with the ancestor-god **"Kabunian."**
3.  Its resonant place in the vast Austronesian family of god-words (*Atua, Akua*).
4.  Its eerie, beautiful echo of the most intimate name for God in the Judeo-Christian tradition.

This evidence suggests that before the formal, hierarchical **Bathala** of the barangays, there may have been a more primordial **Abba**—a divine ancestor, a sky father, whose name became so sacred it was worn down into daily speech, only flashing its original power in moments of extreme emotion or prayer. It is a testament to the depth of Philippine indigenous spirituality, where the name of God was not just spoken in temples, but lived on the lips of the people, hidden in plain sight within a simple, powerful word: **Aba.** -->
