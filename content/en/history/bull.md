<!-- Inter Cætera—May 3 -->

Alexander, etc., to Ferdinand, King

<!-- , and our very dear daughter in Christ, Helisabeth [Isabella], Queen, of Castile and Leon, Aragon,
Sicily, and Granada health and apostolic benediction. Among other works well pleasing to his
divine Majesty, and cherished of our heart, this assuredly ranks highest that in our times
especially the Catholic faith and the Christian religion be everywhere increased and spread, as
well as that the health of souls be procured, and barbarous nations overthrown and brought to the
faith itself. Wherefore inasmuch as by the favor of divine clemency, through no fitting merits of
ours, we have been raised to this holy see of Peter, recognizing that as true Catholic kings and
princes such as we have always known you to be, and as your illustrious deeds already known to
almost the whole world declare, you not only eagerly desire but with every effort, zeal, and
diligence, without regard to hardships, expenses, dangers, with the shedding even of your blood,
are laboring to that end; recognizing besides that already you have long ago dedicated to this
purpose your whole soul and all your endeavors—as witnessed in these times with so much glory
to the divine name in your recovery of the kingdom of Granada from the yoke of the Moors—we
therefore not unrighteously hold it as our duty to grant you even of our own accord and in your
favor those things, whereby daily and with heartier effort you may be enabled for the honor of
God himself and the spread of the Christian rule to accomplish your saintly and praiseworthy
purpose so pleasing to immortal God. In sooth we have learned that, according to your purpose
long ago,  -->

You were looking for some undiscovered far-away islands and mainlands to convert into the Catholic faith. 

<!--  not hitherto discovered by
others, to the end that you might bring to the worship of our Redeemer and profession of the

Catholic faith the inhabitants of them with the dwellers therein; that hitherto, having been
earnestly -->

You have engaged in the siege and recovery of the kingdom of Granada.
<!-- 
 you were unable to
accomplish this saintly and praiseworthy purpose; but, at length, as was pleasing to the Lord, the
said kingdom having been regained, not without the greatest hardships, dangers, and expenses, we
have also learned that with the wish to fulfil your desire, you chose our beloved son -->

You funded Christopher Colon to explore far-away unknown countries through the sea.

 which hitherto no one has sailed;
who in fine with divine aid nor without the utmost diligence sailing in the Ocean Sea, as said,
through western waters towards the Indies, discovered certain very far-away islands and even
mainlands, that hitherto had not been discovered by others. 

Therein dwell very many peoples living in peace, and, as reported, going unclothed, nor users of flesh meat. Moreover, as your
aforesaid envoys are of opinion, these very peoples living in the said islands and countries believe
in one God, Creator in heaven, besides being sufficiently ready in appearance to embrace the
Catholic faith and be trained in good morals. Nor is hope lacking that, were they instructed, the
name of the Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, would easily be introduced into the said countries and
islands. Besides on one of these aforesaid chief islands the above-mentioned Christopher has
already had put together and built a fortress [146] fairly well equipped, wherein he has stationed
as garrison certain Christians, companions of his, who are to make search for other far-away and
unknown islands and countries. In the islands and countries already discovered are found gold,
spices, and very many other precious things of divers kinds and species. Wherefore, as becoming
to Catholic kings and princes, after earnest consideration of all matters especially of the rise and
spread of the Catholic faith, as was the fashion of your ancestors, kings of renowned memory, you
have purposed with the favor of divine clemency to bring under your sway the said countries and
islands with their inhabitants and the dwellers therein, and bring them to the Catholic faith. Hence
in heartiest commendation in the Lord of this your saintly and praiseworthy purpose, desirous too
that it be duly accomplished in the carrying to those regions of the name of our Savior, we exhort
you very earnestly in the Lord and insist strictly—both through your reception of holy baptism,
whereby you are bound to our apostolic commands, and through the bowels of the mercy of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that inasmuch as with upright spirit and through zeal for the true faith you
design to equip and despatch this expedition, you purpose also, as is your duty, to lead the peoples
dwelling in those islands to embrace the Christian profession; nor at any time let dangers or
hardships deter you therefrom, with the stout hope and trust in your hearts that almighty God will
further your undertakings. Moreover, in order that with greater readiness and heartiness you enter
upon an undertaking of so lofty a character as has been entrusted to you by the graciousness of
our apostolic favor, we, moved thereunto by our own accord, not at your instance nor the request
of anyone else in your regard, but of our own sole largess and certain knowledge as well as in the
fulness of our apostolic power, by the authority of almighty God conferred upon us in blessed
Peter and of the vicarship of Jesus Christ which we hold on earth, do by tenor of these presents
give, grant, and assign forever to you and your heirs and successors, kings of Castile and Leon, all
and singular the aforesaid countries and islands thus unknown and hitherto discovered by your
envoys and to be discovered hereafter, providing however they at no time have been in the actual
temporal possession of any Christian owner, together with all their dominions, cities, camps,
places, and towns as well as all rights, jurisdictions, and appurtenances of the same wherever they

may be found. Moreover we invest you and your aforementioned heirs and successors with them,
and make, appoint, and depute you owners of them with full and free power, authority, and
jurisdiction of every kind, with this proviso however, that by this gift, grant, assignment, and
investiture of ours no right conferred on any Christian prince is hereby to be understood as
withdrawn or to be withdrawn. Moreover we command you in virtue of holy obedience, that,
employing all due diligence in the premises, as you promise—nor do we doubt your compliance
therewith to the best of your loyalty and royal greatness of spirit—you send to the aforesaid
countries and islands worthy, God-fearing, learned, skilled, and experienced men in order to
instruct the aforesaid inhabitants and dwellers therein in the Catholic faith, and train them in good
morals. Besides, under penalty of excommunication late sententie to be incurred ipso facto, [147]
should anyone thus contravene, we strictly forbid all persons of no matter what rank, estate,
degree, order, or condition, to dare, without your special permit or that of your aforesaid heirs and
successors, to go for the sake of trade or any other purpose whatever to the said islands and
countries discovered and found by your envoys or persons sent thither. And inasmuch as some
kings of Portugal, by similar apostolic grant made to them, discovered and took possession of
islands in the waters of Africa, Guinea, and the Gold Mine, [148] as well as elsewhere, far which
reason divers privileges, favors, liberties, immunities, exemptions, and indults were granted to
them by this apostolic see, we through similar accord, authority, knowledge, and fulness of our
apostolic power, by a gift of special favor, do empower you and your aforesaid heirs and
successors, in the islands and countries discovered and to be discovered by you, to use, employ,
and enjoy freely and legally, as is right, in all things and through all things, the same as if they had
been especially granted to you and your aforesaid heirs and successors, all and singular these
favors, privileges, exemptions, liberties, faculties, immunities, and indults, whereof the terms of
all we wish understood as being sufficiently expressed and inserted, the same as if they had been
inserted word for word in these presents. Moreover we similarly extend and enlarge them in all
things and through all things in favor of you and your aforesaid heirs and successors, the apostolic
constitutions and ordinances as well as all those things that have been granted in the letters above
or other things whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding. We trust in him from whom derive
empires and governments and everything good, that with the guidance of the Lord over your
deeds, should you pursue this saintly and praiseworthy undertaking, in a short while your
hardships and endeavors will result in the utmost success to the happiness and glory of all
Christendom. But inasmuch as it would be difficult to have these present letters sent to all places
where desirable, we wish, and with similar accord and knowledge do decree that to copies of
them, signed by the hand of a notary public commissioned therefor and sealed with the seal of any
ecclesiastical officer or ecclesiastical court, the same respect is to be shown in court and outside
as well as anywhere else, as would be given to these presents, should they be exhibited or shown.
Let no one, therefore, infringe, or with rash boldness contravene this our exhortation, requisition,
gift, grant, assignment, investiture, deed, constitution, deputation, mandate, inhibition, indult,
exemption, enlargement, will, and decree. Should any one presume to do so, be it known to him
that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God, and of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul. Given in
Rome at St. Peter's, on the third day of May in the year one thousand four hundred and ninety-
three, of the incarnation of our Lord, in the first year of our pontificate.

Eximiæ—May 3
Alexander, etc., to the illustrious sovereigns, our very dear son in Christ Ferdinand, King, and
our very dear daughter in Christ Elizabeth [Isabella], Queen of Castile, Leon, Aragon and
Granada, health, etc. The sincereness and whole-souled loyalty of your exalted attachment to
ourselves and the church of Rome deserve to have us grant in your favor those things whereby
daily you may the more easily be enabled to the honor of Almighty God and the spread of
Christian government as well as the exaltation of the Catholic faith to carry out your saintly and
praiseworthy purpose and the work already undertaken of making search for far-away and
unknown countries and islands. For this very day through our own accord and certain knowledge,
as well as fulness of our apostolic power, we have given, granted, and assigned forever, as appears
more fully in our letters drawn up therefor, to you and your heirs and successors, kings of Castile
and Leon, all and singular the far-away and unknown mainlands and islands lying to the west in
the Ocean Sea, that have been discovered or hereafter may be discovered by you or your envoys,
whom you have equipped therefor not without great hardships, dangers, and expense; providing
however these countries be not in the actual possession of Christian owners. But inasmuch as by
this apostolic see have been granted divers privileges, favors, liberties, immunities, exemptions,
faculties, letters, and indults to some kings of Portugal, who also by similar apostolic grant and
donation in their favor, have discovered and taken possession of other countries and islands in the
waters of Africa, Guinea, and the Gold Coast, with the desire to empower by our apostolic
authority, as also is right and fitting, you and your aforesaid heirs and successors with graces,
prerogatives, and favors of no less character; moved also thereto wholly by our own similar
accord, not at your instance nor the petition of any one else in your favor, but through out own
sole liberality as well as the same knowledge and fulness of our apostolic power, we do by tenor
of these presents, as a gift of special favor, empower you and your aforesaid heirs and successors
to the end that in the islands and countries, already discovered by you or in your name and to be
discovered hereafter, you may freely and legally, as is proper, use, employ, and enjoy in all things
and through all things exactly the same as if they had been granted especially to you and your
aforesaid heirs and successors, all and singular the graces, privileges, exemptions, liberties,
faculties, immunities, letters, and indults that have been granted to the kings of Portugal, the terms
whereof we wish to be understood as sufficiently expressed and inserted, the same as if they had
been inserted word for word in these presents. Moreover we extend similarly and enlarge these
powers in all things and through all things to you and your aforesaid heirs and successors, to
whom in the same manner and form we grant them forever, the apostolic constitutions and
ordinances as well as all grants of similar kind made by letters to the kings of Portugal, as well as
other things whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding. But as it would be difficult to have these
present letters sent to all places where desirable, we wish and with similar accord and knowledge
do decree that to copies of them, signed by the hand of a public notary commissioned therefor,
and sealed with the seal of any ecclesiastical officer or ecclesiastical court, the same respect is to
