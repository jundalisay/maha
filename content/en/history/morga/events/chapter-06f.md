When Governor Don Francisco Tello took office in 1596, 2 ships were despatched:

1. The San Geronymo

This was the ship that Don Fernando de Castro and his wife Doña Ysabel Barreto used to return to Nueva España. It was now set for the port of Cabite.

This sailed last, it made the voyage, reaching Nueva Españia at the end of 1596.

2. The galleon San Felipe

This was laden with Filipinas goods bound for Nueva España.

This was a large ship and heavily laden with merchandise and passengers. Its commander and general was Don Mathia de Landecho.

They encountered many storms on the voyage. At one time, it became necessary to throw considerable cargo overboard.

They lost their rudder while in 37 degrees latitude, 600 leguas from the Filipinas, and 150 from Xapon. 

They could not continue their voyage, so they decided to return to the Filipinas. 

They changed their course but experienced even more difficulties.
- The vessel had no rudder
- The rigging and few sails were carried away and blown into shreds. 

They could not hold the vessel to its course. It went so often to windward that they lost all hope of reaching the Filipinas.

<!-- were in great danger of foundering, and  -->

Japon was the nearest place. But they did not know how the Japanese would receive them.

<!-- , but not sufficiently near to enable them to reach it or to venture near its coast which is very wild, and unknown to them even by sight; and even should they have the good fortune to reach it,  -->

<!-- At this juncture arose confusion and a diversity of opinion among the men aboard. 

Some said that they should not abandon the course to Manila, in spite of the great peril and discomfort that they were experiencing.

Others said that it would be a rash act to do so, and that, since Xapon was much nearer, they should make for it, and look for the port of Nangasaqui, between which and the Filipinas trade was carried on.

There they would be well received and would find means to repair their ships, and of resuming the voyage thence.  -->

The people, especially some religious in the ship, chose to go to Japan. 

 <!-- , for  adopted it, and the rest coincided with them, on the assurance of the pilots that they would quickly take the ship to Xapon. -->

After 6 days, they saw the coast of Xapon, at a province called Toça. [83]

 <!-- and although they tried by day to reach the land, at night, when they lowered the sails, the tide carried them away from it. -->

Many funeas [84] came to the ship from a port called Hurando. 

Their king persuaded the Spaniards of harbor, tackle, and repairs. So they entered the port, after having sounded and examined the entrance, and whether the water was deep enough.

The Japanese were faithless and did this with evil intent. They towed the ship into the port and grounded it for the lack of water.

<!-- , leading and guiding it onto a shoal, where, for lack of water, it touched and . -->

The Spaniards were obliged to unload the ship and take all the cargo ashore close to the town, to a stockade given them for that purpose.

The Japanese gave the Spaniards a good reception. But the repair of the ship and departure needed permission from Taicosama, the sovereign of Japon.

Taicosama had his court in Miaco, 100 leguas from that port.

General Don Matia de Landecho sent their ambassadors to court with a valuable gift from the ship's cargo for Taicosama, to beg him to order their departure:
- Christoval de Mercado
- 3 other Spaniards
- Fray Juan Pobre, of the Franciscan order
- Fray Juan Tamayo, of the Augustinian order

They were to confer concerning this affair with Taico in Miaco, and were to avail themselves of the Franciscan fathers who were in Miaco.

The latter had gone as ambassadors from the Filipinas to settle matters between Xapon and Manila.

They were residing at court in a permanent house and hospital, with Taico's sufferance. 

There they were making a few converts, although with considerable opposition from the Society of Jesus established in Japan. 

The latter asserted other religious to be forbidden by apostolic briefs and royal decrees to undertake or engage in the conversion of Japon.

The king of Hurando seemed friendly and kind to the Spaniards in his port. He took great care to keep them and their merchandise secure.

He immediately sent word to court that that ship of foreigners called Nambajies [85] had been wrecked there, and that the Spaniards had brought great riches. 

This kindled Taicosama's greed, who, in order to get possession of them, sent Ximonojo, one of his favorites and a member of his council, to Hurando.

Ximonojo took possession of all the merchandise, and imprisoned the Spaniards within a well-guarded palisade.

 <!-- after having forced them to give up all their possessions and what they had hid, under pain of death.  -->

Having exercised great rigor therein, he returned to court, after granting permission to the general and others of his suite to go to Miaco.
