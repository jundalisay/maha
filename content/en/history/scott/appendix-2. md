Appendix II
"Mao-li-wu" from Chang Hsieh's Tung Hsi Yang K'ao, ch. 5
Mao-li-wu is the country of Ho-mao-li. The land is small and
the soil barren; the interior of the country is full of mountains, and
beyond the mountains is the open sea. The sea is full of seafood of
all kinds. The people also know farming. In the third year of Yung
Lo [1405] the king of the country sent the Muslim Tao-nu-ma-kao
as emissary to present his credentials; he came to court and made
offerings of native products. This country is neighbor to Lii-sung, so
he came in company with the Lli-sung representative. Afterwards, the
land gradually became fertile, and those simple people also became
cultivated, therefore seafarers have a saying, "If you want wealth,
be sure to go to Mao-H-wu, because it's an excellent land for so
small a country."
There are some Wang-chin-chiao-lao [Maguindanao] people who
are pirates on the seas. They travel in boats using long oars with ends
like gourds cut in half. On occasion, those using these bailers get in
the water to row the boat, and its speed is doubled. Seen in the dis-
tance out on the sea, they are like a few vague dots, but all of a
sudden, the robbers are at hand; then scattering or hinding is of no
avail, and nobody escapes. Mao-li-wu suffered many destructive raids
with great loss of life, so that it has now become poor and wretched.
Merchant ship~ going there avoid it for fear of the robbers, and set
their course ~6r other islands.
Famous sights. Mount Lo-huang: the top is white stone.
Products. Brazilwood. "Seed flowers" [?].
Commerce. When this little country sees the Chinese people's
ships, they are delighted and would never think of mistreating them,
so the conduct of trade is most peaceful. What the Chiao-lao who
practice piracy want is for people to visit that land, and ships that
go there to trade are treated well because they secretly plan to kill
them by this strategy.
