"Butuan" from the Sung Hui Yao Kao, Vol. 197
BUTUAN. Butuan is in the sea. It has had mutual relations
with Champa, but not much communication with China.
In October 1003 its King Ch'i-ling sent Minister Li-i:-han and
Assistant Minister Chia-mi-nan to present tribute of native products
and red parrots. In February 1004 when the New Year Festival was
proclaimed, the Emperor sent messengers in the middle of the night
to fetch the Butuan envcys to see the lanterns and attend the feast,
and they were also given strings of cash. In April 1004 Li-i-han and
the others were sent to present tribute of native products. In October
or November, an official complained, "The Butuan envoys trade for
a lot of Chinese goods, gold, and silver, to take back to their coun-
try, and they also take all kinds of flags and pennons. People from
distant lands don't understand rules and regulations. I would there-
fore recommend that new restrictions be imposed to prohibit their
dealing directly in the marketplace, and making private contracts.''
It was done.
In July or August of 1007 King Ch'i-ling sent Minister I-hsti-han
and others to present tortoise shell, camphor, tai-branches [?], cloves,
mother-oÂ£-cloves, and native products. They were given caps, belts
and robes, dishes and presents, and strings of cash, and provided with
escorts. A month later, Butuan sent 1-hsti-han to hand up a petition:
"Your humble servant observes that the Emperor has bestowed two
caparisoned horses and two large spirit flags on the Champa envoy;
he wishes to be granted the same treatment and to receive the same
favors." An official commented: "Butuan is beneath Champa. If
this rank is granted, I fear there will be no more chief's standards
left. I would recommend instead that they be given five small vari-
colored flags." It was done.
In March 1011 that country's King Hsi-li-pa-ta-hsia-ch'ih also
sent an envoy, Li-kart-hsieh, with a memorial engraved on a gold
tablet, to present cloves, white Barros camphor, tortoise shell, and
red parrots when they came with tribute. At the time of the sacrifice
to the earth god Fen-yin, he ordered his envoys to attend and pre-
sent a K'un-lun slave, but the Emperor was grieved at her being so
strange and far from home, and ordered her sent back. At the same
time, King Ch'ti-lan of the land of San:-ma-lan sent envoys to pre-
sent jars of aromatics, elephant tusks, dates, almonds, "five-flavored
seeds" [Schizandra chinensis], rose-water, fine-grained white sugar,
cloudy glass bottles, and saddles. King Wu-huang of Wti-hstin and
King Ma-wu-ho-lei of P'u-p'o-lo, both small countries in the sea,
sent envoys together to present jars of aromatics and ivory. In July
Li-kan-hsieh was granted the title of Cherished Transformed Gen-
eral, and the San-rna-Ian envoy, Ya-li-pal-ti, Gracious-to-Strangers
General, and Ya-p'ti-lo of P'u-tuan-lo, Honored Skillful General; all
had sacrifices and received favors. The next month Li-kan-hsieh and
the others sent up a memorial exalting their countries and requesting
flags, pennons, and armor to honor distant lands. They were granted.
