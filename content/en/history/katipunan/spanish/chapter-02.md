Freemasonry has been the principal factor for the development in these islands for:
- anti-religious ideas
- secret societies

Some 20 years ago, there was installed in this country, a lodge dependent upon the Gr∴ Or∴ Español (7).

It was inoffensive in its beginning because it was composed of peninsular Spaniards, with the absolute exclusion of natives.

It developed languidly until 1890.

During this epoch, the Filipino colony in Madrid, Hong-Kong and Paris had the exalted separatists:
- José Rizal
- Marcelo H. del Pilar
- Graciano Lopez
- Mariano Ponce
- Eduardo Lete
- Antonio and Juan Luna
- Julio Llorente
- Salvador V. del Rosario
- Doroteo Cortés
- José Baza
- Pedro Serrano
- Moisés Salvador
- Galicano Apacible and many others

There were in communication with the seditious elements of Manila, strove hard to influence don Miguel Morayta (13), (Grand master of the Oriente Español), in Madrid who they were close to.

They wanted the statutes to be reformed so that the native character could be made exclusively Tagalog in the Archipelago.

Conferences, general gatherings, and finally compromises decided in the favor of the Filipinos. Morayta thus, unconsciously sowed the seed.

D. Alejandro Roji, resident in this capital, Captain of Engineers, was nominated general delegate to direct the works.

With ample powers from Morayta, came the native school-teacher Pedro Serrano, who enjoyed in Manila the confidence and protection of the said Colonel.

Serrano was assisted by the Flores, lieutenants of Infantry, Numeriano Adriano, Ambrosio Rianzares, Juan Zulueta, Faustino Villaruel (15), Agustin de la Rosa, Ambrosio Salvador, Andrés Bonifacio (16), Apolinario Mabini (17), Estanislao Legaspi Domingo Franco (18), Román Basa, Deodato Arellano, Antonio Salazar, Felipe Zamora, Nazario Constantino, Bonifacio Arevalo, Pedro Casimiro, Dionisio Ferraz, Timoteo Paez and a thousand others.

They were all indians with a career or a comfortable social position.

They commenced a silent and tenacious propaganda which resulted in 180 Tagalog lodges, extended throughout the territory of Luzon and part of the Bisayas, being constituted in 5 years. 

The character of the native (19), so propitious to all the mysterious and symbolic, easily accustomed itself to the ridiculous practices of freemasonry: the initiations (20), the proofs (21), the oaths (22), attributes, signs and pass words, and the pseudonyms, all and everything surrounded by shade and mystery, appealed to the native and served him as an educative ladder which prepared his mind for his entry into other associations of graver transcendencies, according as the initiators and apostles of filibusterism, Rizal, Pilar, López, Cortés and Zulueta had forseen, as can be proved by that correspondence which has come to my hands.

In order to direct the organization of the lodges dependant upon the Gran Oriente Español, there was constituted by Morayta, a Gran Consejo Regional (23) which received its instructions from him, and which was presided over by Ambrosio Flores (h∴ Muza), and formed of Adriano, Villaruel, Flores (A), Mabini, Paez, Zamora, [17]Mariano and Salazar. The newspaper La Solidaridad (24) which, in the previous year had been founded in Barcelona by M. Pilar, as a delegate of the propaganda of Manila, and the publishing centre of which was later on translated to Madrid, was declared the official organ of all Filipino masonry; and in its collaboration, all the Filipinos of a medium culture resident in the capital, took a hand, under the auspices and direction of its new proprietor, the oft-mentioned and ill-starred Morayta.

«In 1893 the Gran Oriente Nacional, of which the Grand Master is Sr. Pantoja, reporter of the highest tribunal of justice, conceded powers to the lieutenant military councillor Sr. Lacasa, and the sergeant of Infantry, José Martin, to carry on propaganda in these islands among the native element, and in competition with the other Oriente. The result did not correspond to the efforts of the propagandists, who only succeeded in creating some few lodges in the Capital, in Cavite, Cagayan, Iloilo and Negros. How could it be expected to prosper, when the Gran Oriente Español had already catechized the masses of the country!

«It must be declared, although it makes [18]one blush to do so, that many peninsular Spaniards, and among them some holding important official positions in the country, have contributed to this propaganda, scandalous, and from all points of view, aimed at the integrity of the nation (25). Only candor can exculpate them. May the country pardon them.

«From the first moments, both in the organ of Filipino freemasonry, La Solidaridad, and in the circulars which the Gran Oriente sent to Spain for the information of the brethren there resident, was commenced a coarse and shameless campaign against the Monastic Orders (26), and of scoffing and ridicule of religion. Later on, this campaign acquired a political character, attacking the government of the metropolis, and the authorities of the archipelago, demanding liberal reforms for the country, such as representation in the Cortes, the colonial Cámara, municipal autonomy, increase of individual rights etc. etc., Let anyone with half an eye examine carefully the collections of the cited paper, and he will certainly meet with something contrary to the national unity, artfully and modestly hidden. Let him read the almost [19]countless number of documents (27) pertaining to the Tagalog lodges, and sent by me to the judge, Señor Olive, which were united to the charges, and the most incredulous will be convinced that the lodges and their aids and abettors devoted themselves to something more than the propaganda of freemasonry. There is not a single one of the chiefs and organizers of the filibuster organizations up to this time discovered, who is not a freemason.»
