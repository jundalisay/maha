### Office Of Legislative Affairs (OLA)

This is the liaison between the Executive and the Legislative.

The White House must work with congressional leaders to ensure presidential nominees, for roles such as Cabinet secretaries and ambassadors, are confirmed by the Senate. The White House also relies on Congress to enact reforms promised by the President on the campaign trail, whether those promises relate to health care, education, or national defense. Because Congress holds the power of the purse, White House staffers must ensure that there is enough support on the Hill to secure the necessary funding through the appropriations process to fulfill the President’s agenda. The OLA reports directly to the Chief of Staff and in some Administrations has done so under the guidance of a Deputy Chief of Staff (usually the Deputy Chief


### OFFICE OF PRESIDENTIAL PERSONNEL (PPO)

The political axiom that “personnel is policy” was popularized under President Ronald Reagan during the 1981 presidential transition. One of the most important offices in the White House is the PPO, which was created under President Richard Nixon to centralize political appointments. Departments and agencies had and still have direct legal authority on hiring and firing, but the power to fill Schedule C posi- tions—the core of political jobs—is vested with the President. Therefore, the White House, not the department or agency, has the final word on political appointments. PPO’s primary responsibility is to staff the executive branch with individuals who are equipped to implement the President’s agenda. Although its focus should be identifying and recruiting leaders to fill the approximately 1,000 appointments that require Senate confirmation, PPO must also fill approximately 3,000 political jobs that require dedicated conservatives to support the Administration’s political leadership.

for Policy). Regardless of the person to whom the OLA reports, however, the office exercises a certain autonomy on behalf of the President and the Chief of Staff in directly influencing congressional leaders of both major political parties. The OLA often must function as the mediator among the parties and find common ground to facilitate the successful enactment of the President’s agenda. As is the case with many White House offices (but especially the Office of Com- munications), the OLA must ensure that congressional leaders receive one unified message. If other actors within the White House maintain their own relationships with congressional leaders and staffers, it may appear that the President’s agenda is fractured and lacks consensus. This dynamic has caused real problems for many Presidents in the past.


Internally, OLA staffers need to be involved in policy discussions, budget reviews, and other important meetings. They must also provide advice to policy staffers regarding whether certain ideas are politically feasible. Externally, OLA staffers have to communicate continuously with congressional offices of both parties in both the House and the Senate to ensure that the President has enough support to enact his legislative priorities or sustain votes.

The OLA requires staffers who are effective communicators and can provide a
dose of reality to other White House staffers when necessary. Although a policy
proposal from within the White House may be a great idea, OLA staffers must
ensure that it is politically feasible. OLA staffers must therefore be skilled in both
politics and policy. Furthermore, the President should seek out individuals who
can advance his agenda and at the same time forge pathways with members of the
opposing political party on other priorities.
Most important, the OLA must function as a well-oiled machine: precisely
synced. The President cannot afford to have a tennis player on—much less as the
leader of—his football team.

Frequently, many medium-tier and top-tier jobs have been filled by policy
experts tasked with accomplishing much of the work of the Administration. At
the same time, appointees in the entry-level jobs have brought invaluable energy
and commitment to the White House and have proved to be the “farm team” for
the conservative movement.

The Office of Presidential Personnel is responsible for:

Vetting potential political personnel by conducting political background
checks and reviewing any clearance and fitness assessments by departments
and agencies.
Making recommendations to the President and to other appointment
authorities on behalf of the President.
Identifying programmatic political workforce needs early and developing
plans (for example, Schedule F).

Identifying potential political personnel both actively through recruitment
and passively by fielding resumes and adjudicating requests from
political actors.

Maintaining a strong relationship with the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) both for operational purposes and to effectuate the President’s direct
Title 5 authorities. The President is in charge of the federal workforce and
exercises control principally by working through the Director of the Office
of Personnel Management.
Training and connecting political personnel.
Playing “bad cop” in a way that other White House offices cannot
(including serving as the office that takes direct responsibility for firings
and hirings).
Serving as a personnel link between conservative organizations and the
executive branch.

In most Administrations, PPO will staff more than 100 positions during a transi-
tion and thousands of noncareer positions during the President’s first term. Direct
authority and a strong relationship with the President are necessary attributes for
any PPO Director. Historically, PPO has had direct review and control of personnel
files, including security clearance dossiers.

At the highest level, PPO is tasked with long-term, strategic workforce devel-
opment. The “billets” of political appointments are of immense importance in
credentialing and training future leaders. In addition, whatever one’s view of the
constitutionality of various civil service rules (for example, the Federal Vacancies
Reform Act of 19986) might be, it is necessary to ensure that departments and
agencies have robust cadres of political staff just below senior levels in the event
of unexpected vacancies.
