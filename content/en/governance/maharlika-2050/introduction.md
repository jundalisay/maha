Maharlika 2050 is a set of policies inspired by the Mandate for Leadership to impleent the principles of Maharlikanism which is derived from the principles of Supersociology.

Unlike most think tanks that propose policies to solve current problems, Maharlika 2050 creates a template to solve current problems and also for the future when humans start moving to other planets.

This is why its main themes are independence, self-reliance, resilience, yet is cooperative and responsive to changes.
