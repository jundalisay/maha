The recent unmasking of a vast fraud network of ghost flood-control projects has exposed the moral decadence in the Philippine government which has been known since its first President Roxas of the Liberal Party.

{{< youtube HEiJIUKSXDY >}}

The government started with low morals and so it is no wonder that the Republic has been plagued with corruption scandals ever since, the most serious being during the Marcos Sr regime. 

Yet after the EDSA Revolution which got rid of Marcos Sr, corruption continued with:
- Estrada as Jueteng payoffs, Hotcars Scam, and Textbook Scam
- Arroyo as the Fertilizer Fund Scam
- Aquino as the PDAF Scam, Tanim-Bala Scam
- Dutertes as Pharmally Scam and POGOs
- Marcos Jr as Flood control Scam and Ghost Projects

We explain that the [dharmagenesis](https://www.superphysics.org/superphysics/principles/chapter-03e/) of the Philippine government in 1946 was corrupt in the first place.

This is because Philippine society did not have an enlightened moral philosophy to act as the proper foundation. 

In contrast:
- Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China have Confucian morals
- The US and Western Europe have European Enlightenment morals

Since the base or starting point of the Philippine government was corruptible, then the Philippine government necessarily became corrupt consistently. 

Its moral foundation was a combination of Spanish Catholicism and American materialism. 
- These are naturally contradictory just as the Church is pro-austerity, modesty, and against excessive wealth. 
- Likewise, materialism is against the unscientfic dogma of the Church. 

Maharlikanism, as an implementation of Supersociology, goes against both flawed moral philosophies:
- The [principles of Supersociology](https://www.superphysics.org/social/supersociology/principles/part-1/) counteracts the poverty and immorality caused by Catholicism
- The [principles of Supereconomics](https://www.superphysics.org/social/economics/principles/) counteracts the economic crises caused by Materialism

The solution to poverty and corruption in the Philippines is to get rid of Catholic morals. 


## Why Catholicism Leads to Corruption and Poverty

Catholicism was created by the Roman Empire by adopting Jewish moral philosophy wholesale after they conquered Jerusalem. 

This was because the Roman religion was based on the messy system established by Homer and Hesiod.

In contrast, the Jewish system was more organized. It had:
- 10 Commandments and a legal framework in Exodus
- the concept of miracles from the New Testament
- political history and dynamics from the Old Testament

From the Jewish system, the Romans cherry-picked beliefs that matched the goals of the Roman Empire.

Its main scheme is to adopt the ideas of:
- original sin and afterlife instead of reincarnation in order to impose social obedience and control. This creates an artificial problem.
- a Savior to save people from original sin and guarantee a good afterlife. This creates the solution. 

So the Roman Empire deviously creates a problem that only it can solve. This maintains its *mental* power over the people when political power fails due to the incapacity of its emperors. 

This is similar to how the banking system enshrines money as the tool of trade that creates financial crises that only the banking system can solve. 


## Mercantilism Overthrows the Catholic Priest Class

The adoption of Roman Catholicism really marks the decline of the Warrior class of Emperors and the rise of the intellectual class of priests. 

The expansion of world trade in the 17th century led to the rise of the Merchant class in Europe. 

Instead of tithes, poll taxes, and land tax from the priest and warrior classes, the revenue of government became taxes on goods as tariffs, excise and sales taxes from the merchant class. 

This culminated in the French Revolution which separated Church and State. 

This did not happen in the Arab countries where church and state are still one. This is because the Prophet Mohammad created Islam as a complete system, with civil law, economic policies, political, and metaphysical principles. 




## Corruption: The Threat of Hell is Ineffective

The main tool of Catholicism against crime and corruption is the *abstract* threat of Hell. This usually is effective against weak-minded people who are easily influenced by indoctrination and admonitions.

The big problem is that criminals are strong willed and are able to against indoctrination. 

So their minds are able to overcome the fear of Hell, which does not exist anyway. Instead, they use their intellect and skill to avoid being caught, or by using guns, goons, and gold.

Men have made use of confession, communion, and all the other sacraments, to commit the most horrible crimes

Corruption in government is obviously the main cause of poverty in any country. This is best seen in the wealth divide between North and South Korea. 



## Poverty from Overpopulation

Another systemic cause of poverty is the increase of the unproductive population over the productive, as explained by Adam Smith.

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="The Wealth of Nations, Introduction" >}}
The amount of work done depends on the proportion of useful and skilled labour employed to the labour not so employed.
{{< /q >}}


Each child requires a lot of labor by the parents to grow properly, just as crops need a lot of water, fertilizer, pesticide, and care and attention of the farmer. 

Having too many children relative to the productive capacity of the parents leads to neglect of the children. This then makes the children grow wrongly, increasing the unproductive population. 

This is seen in malnutrition which reduces the learning capacity of the children. 

The poor know of their limitations very well, and so they justly try to abort their fetuses. 

However, the government absurdly bans abortion, preventing the poor from solving their own problems. 

Instead, the government tries to solve the learning deficiency by increasing the educational budget and switching to K-12.

Yet tests show that functional literacy still continues to decline. 

This is because no matter how much education you give to a child stupified by a defective nervous system, the child will stay naturally stupid.

##  The Solution: Replace Catholic Morals with Natural Dharma

The two biggest drivers of poverty, as corruption and overpopulation, are both sourced from the Catholic dogma inherited from Spanish times. 

This same pattern shows in other Christian and Islamic countries. To prove this, we listed the most corrupt countries along with their religion and male haplogroup (genetics):


Corruption Score | Countries | Religion | Haplogroup of most populous country
--- | --- | --- | ---
33 | Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Philippines, Sierra Leone | Christian | R1a, O2-M122, E-M2
32 | Angola, Ecuador, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Togo, Uzbekistan | Christian | E1b1a
31 | Djibouti, Papua New Guinea, Peru | Christian | M
30 | Egypt, El Salvador, Mauritania | Islam | E1b1b1a
28 | Bolivia, Guinea | Christian | Q1a3a 
27 | Eswatini, Gabon, Liberia, Mali, Pakistan | Islam | R1a1
26 | Cameroon, Iraq, Madagascar, Mexico, Nigeria, Uganda | Christian | R1b
25 | Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Mozambique | Christian | E1b1a
24 | Central African Republic, Paraguay | Christian | R1b
23 | Bangladesh, Congo, Iran | Islam | H
22 | Azerbaijan, Honduras, Lebanon, Russia | Christian | R1a
21 | Cambodia, Chad, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Zimbabwe | Christianity | R1b
20 | Democratic Republic of the Congo | Christanity | E-M2
19 | Tajikistan | Islam |
17 | Afghanistan | Islam |
16 | Myanmar | Buddhism | 
15 | North Korea, Sudan | Islam | J
14 | Nicaragua | Christianity | 
13 | Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Yemen | Islam | E-M81
12 | Syria | Islam |
10 | Venezuela | Christianity | R1b
9 | Somalia | Islam | E3b1
8 | South Sudan | Christian | A


The common pattern in corrupt countries is the strength of Christanity and Islam, and the African E gene. 

<!-- Of the countries in this list, only Sri Lanka,  Myanmar, and Cambodia have a different religion as Buddhism. North Korea is non-religious.  -->

Among the least corrupt countries, the most common pattern is being non-religious and the Westerb European R1b gene and the East Asian O gene. 

We call the non-religious as natural dharma, which the Europeans called reason.


Corruption Score | Countries | Religion | Haplogroup of most populous country
--- | --- | --- | ---
90 | Denmark | non-religious | R1b
88 | Finland | non-religious | N1a1
84 | Singapore | multiple | multiple 
83 | New Zealand | non-religious | R1b
81 | Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland | Lutheran | R1b
80 | Sweden | Christian | I1a
78 | Netherlands | non-religious | R1b
77 | Australia, Iceland, Ireland | Christanity | R1b
76 | Estonia, Uruguay | Christianity | R1b
75 | Canada, Germany | Christianity | R1b 
74 | Hong Kong | multiple | O2A2
72 | Bhutan, Seychelles | Buddhist | D1 
71 | Japan, United Kingdom | Shinto | O
69 | Belgium | Christianity | R1b
68 | Barbados, United Arab Emirates | Islam | J1
67 | Austria, France, Taiwan | Christianity | R1b
65 | Bahamas, United States | Christianity | R1b
64 | Israel, South Korea | non-religious | O2


The corrupt contries are also known to be poor, while the least corrupt ones are wealthy. 


## Specific Changes

As it is unrealistic to hope to convert Christians and Muslims into the natural Dharma, we instead suggest tweaks 

Catholic | Dharmic
--- | --- 
Hell to create fear of crimes | Actual training on the karma or consequence of crimes to the self and society
Ban on Abortion from ignorance of the dynamics of the soul | Scientific findings on the formation of the nerves of the fetus
Ignorance on the pre-reincarnation limbo state of the soul | Advanced meditation to see one's own past lives


Instead of hoping that criminals will fear of God, it is better to add teeth to the law. 

Ancient countries and modern Confucian countries like Singapore and China do this through corporal and capital punishment. This creates real consequences that strike and etch themselves in the brain. 

To solve poverty, abortion before the 8th week of fetus development should be legal. 

This will allow the poor to control their own population and prevent the rise of unproductive labor which acts as dead weight and liability to society. 

{{< i s="/photos/econ/poverty.jpg" a="Poverty" c="Preventing a soul from having a miserable life in poverty is a great service to that soul, while allowing it to bear its karma" >}}


To remove the fear of killing the fetus, metaphysics of reincarnation has to be taught, as known by the ancient Greeks, Hindus, and Taoists.

The people have to be taught that the soul does not inhabit the fetus until the 7th week. This is the foundation of the [Heartbeat Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_bill) in the United States. 

In Asian philosophy, a soul that is prevented from inhabiting a fetus will merely wait for the next opportunity for the next available fetus. 

This is mirrored by the concept of Descartes' Pineal Gland and the Essassani's explanation:

{{< youtube 0FcP3WEqER4 >}}


Removing a fetus before the 7th week is the same as removing an unfertilized egg during menstruation or wasting sperm during ejaculation -- these are not murder. 


## Undo the Damage from Religion

Getting rid of Catholicism is the single best policy to reduce both Poverty and Corruption.


The Europeans adopted Catholicism and entered the dark ages, which they solved by replacing Dogma with Reason through their Enlightenment. 

East Asia was able to avoid Catholicism by closing its doors during the European colonial period.

Getting rid of Catholicism in the Philippines can be done gradually by replacing Catholic ideas with Maharlikan ones. For example, we replace the Ama Namin with Abba Namin which has elements of the Vedas, Karma Yoga, and Tantra.

<!-- The criteria is to compare it with a country with similar genetics and latitude. A good benchmark is Thailand which only has 72m and a GDP of $526b because of its successful family planning program from 1968 which used contraceptives, and abortion from 2014.
In contrast, Vietnam implemented its 2 child policy only from 2009 and so it has a high population of 101m and lower GDP $476b.
Philippines is the worst with 115m population and lower GDP than Vietnam at $461b.
Egypt also bans abortion and has higher 116m population and much lower GDP at $389b. But that is from its different location and race.
The Romans banned abortion because they had a conscript army made of citizens and needed to keep their population up.
Again, abortion before the 8th week is not killing just as menstruation is not killing the egg.
The problem with you is that you have been indoctrinated so deeply Catholic junk that it overrides your common sense.
"Soul jumping" is called reincarnation and is already an established fact in Hindu and Buddhist countries. Tibetan Buddhists even have practices to control where a soul ends up in the next life and tests to prove whether a child is really someone from a past life.
So the bashing of Catholic junk and the Stupid Roman God is a moral duty for those who want to see Philippines stop being corrupt and poor. 👊
Even the Europeans got rid of their own Catholic junk through the Glorious Revolution and French Revolution and Reformation and were able to progress.
