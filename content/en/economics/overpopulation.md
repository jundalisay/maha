<!-- The criteria is to compare it with a country with similar genetics and latitude. A good benchmark is Thailand which only has 72m and a GDP of $526b because of its successful family planning program from 1968 which used contraceptives, and abortion from 2014.
In contrast, Vietnam implemented its 2 child policy only from 2009 and so it has a high population of 101m and lower GDP $476b.
Philippines is the worst with 115m population and lower GDP than Vietnam at $461b.
Egypt also bans abortion and has higher 116m population and much lower GDP at $389b. But that is from its different location and race.
The Romans banned abortion because they had a conscript army made of citizens and needed to keep their population up.
Again, abortion before the 8th week is not killing just as menstruation is not killing the egg.
The problem with you is that you have been indoctrinated so deeply Catholic junk that it overrides your common sense.
"Soul jumping" is called reincarnation and is already an established fact in Hindu and Buddhist countries. Tibetan Buddhists even have practices to control where a soul ends up in the next life and tests to prove whether a child is really someone from a past life.
So the bashing of Catholic junk and the Stupid Roman God is a moral duty for those who want to see Philippines stop being corrupt and poor. 👊
Even the Europeans got rid of their own Catholic junk through the Glorious Revolution and French Revolution and Reformation and were able to progress.
