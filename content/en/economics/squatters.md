Republic Act No. 3844, otherwise known as the Agricultural Land Reform Code, took effect. The said law abolished the NARRA 

To build homes for the homeless, they had to attract workers from the provinces, reversing Magsaysay's strategy. 

Mr. Celdran is totally wrong about the root causes of the rise of squatters in Manila. 

Diosdado Macapagal's policies are the root cause of most of the problems the Philippines has today, especially squatters. Magsaysay and Garcia were able to contain the squatter problem through the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) which resettled the urban poor to agricultural land. Macapagal changed course and abolished NARRA and instead chose to develop urban housing through the People's Homesite Corp, later to be the NHA with Marcos. Marcos took Macapagal's strategy and oversized it, as proven by QC Projects, BF Homes, and Ayala Alabang. The more they tried to solve the squatter problem, the more the problem worsened until it has become a gigantic problem today.
