The Rice Tariffication Law is the single biggest mistake of the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022 called Ambisyon Natin during the Duterte Administration. 

It began with the rice crisis of September 2018 as the rapid increase in the prices of rice. But this was a natural consequence of the increased taxes from the TRAIN tax reform which was supported by NEDA itself.

Instead of strengthening NFA* to deal with the crisis, the Senate and Lower House actually destroyed it through the Rice Tariffication Law (RTL) in order to allow rice importation.

<!-- Had Duterte dropped Duque during the pandemic, his approval ratings would not have dipped in 2020 and 2021. Duterte's unnecessary reliance on Arroyo is proof of her genius
 -->


The lawmakers thought, that by removing quotas and imposing a tiny 35% tariff that went to local farmers, local rice production would increase as to reduce the price of rice. 

In reality, the warehouses didn't bother buying from scattered local producers* and instead bought in bulk from a single importer, gaining from economies of scale. Without buyers for local rice, the local farmers had a glut of unsold rice. <!-- were already full of foreign rice and so the local rice could not be sold.  -->This is similar to local carrots not finding a market because the market was already occupied by Chinese carrots which could be bought by warehouses easily in bulk.

{{< n n="*The error of the proponent of RTL was to apply [equilibrium theory (1.5 mb pdf)](https://www.phcc.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Issues-Paper-Rice-030819-cover-1.pdf) on a basic seasonal necessity such as rice. This is the same error that liberalized California's power industry as the energy spot-market, that led to their energy crisis. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo imported this scheme to create EPIRA that regularly brings power outages and price spikes." >}}



Didn't the lawmakers know that the secret to rice and agricultural self-sufficiency is for the government to control all parts of the chain from production, transportation, milling, warehousing, wholesaling, and even exporting? 

Didn't they know that this is what Vietnam does with state-owned Vinafood which allows them to export rice cheaply to the world?

<!-- Didn't they know that the Philippines is among the largest rice importers in the world, and is Vietnam's biggest customer?  -->

Didn't they know that Marcos replicated this with the NFA (milling), Food Terminal Inc as FTI (storage), and Kadiwa stores (retail) which allowed the country to export rice in the past?


## The Problem with Neoliberal Keynesianism

These problems are really rooted in the flawed assumptions of Keynesianism which spread after the 2008 Financial Crisis. Because of the doctrine of profit maximization, the burden of driving growth fell to the government which had to build huge projects, get debt, then raise taxes to pay for that debt. 

In the case of Dutertenomics, TRAIN and food importation (Rice Tarrification) was used to pay for Build Build Build. It oppresses consumers and farmers to support the construction industry. It is not a growth that is inclusive nor balanced.


Our social cycles model predicts that the pandemic will last a long time, yet NEDA and lawmakers are still acting like the old normal. They have not scrapped their old neoliberal ways and still think that market forces will somehow relieve the people of their suffering.

Market forces cannot solve the current economic problems of the Philippines because such forces are based on **selfish-interest**, while the alleviation of the suffering of others is a **selfless-interest**. *A person, policy, or system cannot be selfish and selfless at the same time!*

Pharmally was able to buy Lamborghinis simply because it used the market forces of supply, demand, and financing to its private advantage, at the expense of a huge public debt which has to be paid by future generations. 

In fact, the pandemic has proven that nationalized basics* via semi-state-owned corporations are the way of the future, as proven by China and Singapore**.

Only the close coordination of various essential services can create a society strong enough to weather the shocks from global warming caused by the selfish <!-- winner-take-all --> behavior of market forces. This close coordination can only be done by the government which is supposed to have the public interest.

Government management of mercantile projects like this requires orderly, vigilant, and parsimonious administration, like those in Venice and Amsterdam..The post office is properly a mercantile project. Its capital is not very big. There is no mystery in the business. The returns are certain and immediate.

Our next post will explain how to implement this solution and overhaul Ambisyon 2040 into Maharlika 2050.   

Why did Duterte not veto this bill? Could it be because it was actually supported by his own NEDA which is infested with neoliberals?

Why didn't he just use his military to arrest the smugglers and cartels citing economic sabotage?

Could it be because he was ignorant of food policy in the same way that he was ignorant about Covid response and so he had to rely on 'health experts' such as the IATF which had flip-flopping policies*?


<!-- > *Miriam Defensor-Santiago filed Senate Bill 1573 "Pandemic and All-Hazards Prepareness Act" on September 5, 2013 but was ignored by the same despicable senate that made the Rice Tariffication Law -->

<!-- ## The Pandemic Will Make Neoliberalism Obsolete Eventually

The people **should avoid voting for those people who created the Rice Tariffication Law**. A quick workaround would be to:
- raise the tariffs to 700% like what Japan does, instead of the current 35% or 100%. Adam smith would call this 'taxation to the point of prohibition'
- use the tax revenue to rebuild NFA, FTI, and Kadiwa into a state-owned corporation directly under the executive or as an independent consitutional body
- remove neoliberals from policymaking that involves basic essentials. This would be more realistic if the NFA were a separate constitional body like the Comelec -->

<!-- Duterte won by landslide in 2016 thanks to his anti-drug and anti-corruption campaign. He promised to get rid of drugs and corruption in a few months, not knowing that [the country's metaphysics](/articles/metaphysics) actually caused those problems naturally.

His solution was to:
- weed out corrupt government officials by firing them, and
- eliminate the drug trade by killing the drug dealers and drug lords. 

These are shallow solutions that focus on the effect instead of the cause. Duterte never thought that:
- the corruption was created by the morals of American materialism which ascribed goodness to riches
- the drug trade was created by the desire for drugs which was encouraged by American liberalism

Proof is that during the Spanish times, the problem was only corruption, through the friars, (from the Spanish and the Church) and not drugs. This is because the Spanish imposed Catholic morals which empowered the Church, but went against drugs. South America was colonized by both Spain and America (Bay of Pigs, Nicaraguan Contras) and also have a corruption and drug problem much worse than the Philippines.

### Police Empowerment Without a Parallel Enforcement of Morality

Policies that only deal with effects, and not the cause, will require constant work by law enforcement. It would be like a boat with a leaky hull that is solved by scooping out the water instead of plugging the leaks. This explains why Duterte has to raise the salaries of the police and military to keep them working on the drug problem. 

The Roman Empire also did the same thing by raising the salaries of centurions and the Pretorian guards. This led to constant coups whenever the emperors couldn't raise them any longer. In fact, Rome had a year where they switched between five emperors! 

Liberals properly fear this and is why they are going against the anti-terror bill, as well as the empowerment given to the police and military. This fear is justified by the abuses of the police who kill people arbitrarily, such as the one who shot and killed a mother and her son on video in broad daylight. 

The only solution of Duterte is to blame those erring policemen as 'defects' of the Police Academy. At the moment, it is only Duterte's iron will that keeps the military and police from going back to their old corrupt ways*.

> *Crime and abuse are ultimately moral issues, to which our solution is a set of Constitutional Virtues. Britain also had a similar case wherein a police officer raped and killed a woman. This is proof that such a moral problem exists in rich and poor countries alike. 

After Duterte is gone, who will check an empowered military and police elite? -->
