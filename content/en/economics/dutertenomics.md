During his presidential campaign Duterte promised to give a comfortable life to the poor. However, the unstoppable inflation* from 2020 directly contradicts this promise since it makes life less comfortable.


{{< n n="*This inflation can be most easily reduced by a global ban on cryptocurreny mining and NFTs as explained [here](https://www.superphysics.org/social/economics/solutions/2020-inflation)" >}}


To see where the contradiction occurs, let's dissect Dutertenomics. Its most prominent parts are:

- Build Build Build
- TRAIN Law (This is higher taxation used to pay for Build Build Build)
- Ease of business
- Land Distribution
- Continuation of *Pantawid Pamilya* of Noynoy Aquino

These policies are consistent with the Keynesian doctrine, except for "Pantawid Pamilya" which is Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT), a modified version of Universal Basic Income (UBI) implemented by former President Noynoy Aquino.

### Maharlikanismm Note

CCT is a neoliberal policy* that [helps development banks](https://www.superphysics.org/social/economics/solutions/how-to-solve-inequality) such as the World Bank by giving employment to the bank's consultants and its money. 

The non-neoliberal, non-liberal financial way of poverty alleviation is called microfinance. The conservative way is welfare either by the state via social security or by religion via thites or forced donations.

Likewise, tech startups lobby for UBI to give employment to themselves via blockchain and other fancy new technologies, even if there might be no added benefit for the poor.

<!-- - allowing overseas Filipino workers to return in 2020 during the pandemic
  - This increased the Covid outbreak which crashed the economy. In contrast, Vietnam banned its own citizens from returning and was able to be Covid free in 2020
- the other policies of NEDA -->

<!-- Thus, Pantawid Pamilya is the first sign of policy inconsistency. Brazil's version is *Bolsa Familia* which was discontinued after it was proven that it had little effect on alleviating poverty.  -->

The original Dutertenomics itself is quite limited, so it absorbed the NEDA* plan called **Ambisyon Natin 2040**. This was created by Arsenio Balisacan of the neoliberal Philippine Competition Commission during Noynoy Aquino's administration.


{{< n n="*NEDA is the economic planning agency of the Philippine government. Ambisyon Natin 2040 is split into chunks called Philippine Development Plans, similar to Communist Five-Year Plans. The first plan is for 2017-2022. The next one is for 2023-2028." >}}



### [Ambisyon Natin 2040](https://2040.neda.gov.ph/about-ambisyon-natin-2040): Neoliberalism Under the Guise of Socialism

This policy was formulated by interviewing 10,000 people around the nation, asking them what they and the country should achieve by 2040. Since the country is poor, then of course we can expect that the answers will reflect the shallow desires of poor people:
- 79% want a comfortable life
- 17% want a an affluent life

<!-- 'Comfortable life' is then defined as having:
- a medium-sized home (61%)
- a car (59%)
- college education (73%)
- local vacation (84%)
-->

It revealed that the uneducated wanted to study: <!-- An alarming trend is the national preference of subjects to study, with --> 
- teaching*
- business administration
- tourism
- law


{{< n n="*Venezuela also spent a lot on teaching and social welfare through their Bolivarian programs, but is now dirt-poor. This is because we blindly expect teachers to teach the right things, not thinking that they could also teach the wrong things as well." >}}

<!-- This teaching of wrong things probably helped Maduro retain power, since governance and subordination are all based on opinion.  -->

These subjects are easy and so lead to low-value services (in red below). Few people want to study the difficult subjects that lead to high value employment (in green).

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/neda2.jpg" alt="NEDA" >}}


Also alarming is the preference for cars over public transport such as buses and trains.

{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/nedatrain.jpg" alt="NEDA Train" >}}



NEDA then built policies around this data:

- It added more road projects under the Build, Build, Build program instead of creating a proper state-owned bus system (NEDA, as a neoliberal agency, might never allow anything state-owned)
- It emphasized tourism and hospitality
<!-- - shortened business registration -->
- It ignored support for medical training and beefing up the healthcare system. Instead, it focused on the financial aspect of healthcare as health insurance through the Universal Healthcare Law<!--  which will drain the budget of 257 billion pesos --> <!-- which will need to be borrowed (utang) --><!-- this is probably from the 2010 nursing problem -->
- It focused on rice tariffication to allow imports <!-- while building up rice production --> in the guise of lowering food prices to benefit the poor. This is classic neoliberalism

As expected, these **backfired** when the unexpected pandemic hit:

- The lockdowns prevented people from travelling and from using the new roads from Build Build Build
- Tourism collapsed<!-- , rendering the public investment in it useless -->
<!-- - a lot of businesses closed down -->
- The lack of support for medical training led to a shortage of nurses, which made universal healthcare act irrelevant
- Rice tariffication led to agircultural imports that did not reduce rice prices, but instead destroyed local agriculture <!-- which created anomalies in rice supply -->
<!-- - , leading to the current high food prices -->


## The NEDA Flaw: A Reverse Kind of Survivorship Bias

The glaring error with the NEDA plan was that **it created economic policy from interviews with the people**. The problem is that a poor country like the Philippines will likely be full of poor people. **If you ask poor people what they want, then they will give answers that will propagate the same poverty**.

NEDA's mistake is a kind of [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)*.


{{< img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Survivorship-bias.svg/220px-Survivorship-bias.svg.png" >}}



{{< n n="*Researchers in the UK in World War 2 observed that the returning British bombers had parts of their wings missing. The Americans wrongly advised that armor should be added to those parts. But Hungarian mathematician Abraham Wald argued the opposite, that armor should be added to the non-missing wing parts. The Americans were looking at the effect, while Wald was looking at the cause." >}}



An easy proof of this bias is the national preference for subjects like teaching, lawyering, tourism, and business administration that lead to low value jobs. Are Germany, Japan, South Korea known for their teachers, lawyers, tourism, or accountants? No. They're known for their advanced manfuacturing as Siemens, Hyundai, and Mitsubishi.

{{< n n="*Tito Sotto is correct in saying that the country already has too many lawyers. Yet, public policy does nothing to discourage law schools or to make the bar exam more selective and restrictive <!--  the NEDA interview says that more people want to be lawyers than nurses. This is because nursing is hard work and low pay, while lawyering is easier. -->" >}}


Another proof is the preference for cars over public transport. Did Japan, France, and Singapore solve their public transportation by allowing cars as a public policy? No. In fact, they had the opposite policy which oppressed car owners with high taxes and built subways and *shinkansen* instead of freeways. 

**By implementing policies that are OPPOSITE of what poor people want, the Japanese, Singaporeans, French, and Germans are actually able to have a more COMFORTABLE life.** 

**By implementing policies the poor people want, Venezuela and Brazil put themselves into POVERTY.** 


## More Proof of Ignorance of Policymakers

NEDA policy builds a lot of roads to address the demand for cars. They never think that if their policy succeeds then more people will actually own cars. **These cars will then flood the new roads to create new traffic jams!** 

<!-- and there will be traffic again -- all the huge debt for Build Build Build would have been for little gain --><!--  led to the same problem.  -->

If policymakers just let people have their way, then the nation will degenerate quickly with everyone buying cars, flocking to easy jobs, and no one* doing the difficult or low-paying ones. 

{{< n n="*This is seen in the lack of local vaccine manufacturing, simply because only a few people ever wanted to study virology" >}}


 <!-- Build Build Build construction projects being done by Chinese contractors instead of local ones, simply because few locals took the time and effort to learn new construction techniques, or have been brain-drained away -->

If everyone wants to be a singer, boxer, or online seller, then who will plant crops, build the power plants, do the medical services, or create vaccines?

If few people plant crops, build power plants, hospitals, and vaccines, then those goods and services will have a shortage.

If there is a shortage then their prices rise and there will be more Pharmally-style importation<!--  like  wherein foreigners use taxpayer money to buy Lamborghinis -->. 

If their prices rise then life would not be comfortable, violating the very goal of the policy.


Thus, **Ambisyon Natin 2040 naturally goes against itself**


Proof of this is **the collapse of the economy in 2020** which NEDA says is expected to recover only after 10 long years. They blame the pandemic instead of themselves. This is absurd since the economy of other countries are not so badly affected. Even poor Cuba, heavily embargoed by the US, is able to make Covid vaccines simply because the government encouraged more people to study difficult subjects.  

<!-- The only solution of NEDA and the Department of Finance is to borrow money -- **the same measure that Marcos took to fix the flawed policies of Virata and Ongpin**! -->

Ambisyon 2040 is still consistent with our earlier observation that [local policymakers, whether liberal 'dilawan' or nationalist 'loyalista', are ignorant of cause and effect](/maharlika/history/golden-years-marcos). This ignorance seemed to begin in the early 1960s after the presidency of Magsaysay* and Garcia who still had the right policies. 

{{< n n="*Magsaysay for example fought against the pro-American Bell Trade act,  whereas Macapagal blindly accepted the pro-American decontrol policy of 1962. The decontrol destroyed local industrialization and allowed the country to get in debt with the IMF -- a practice carried to perfection by Marcos and Latin American dictators" >}}

<!-- , even among the educated Virata, Ongpin, Purisima, Dominguez, Pernia, and Chua then lead to the wrong policies which then cause the country to stay largely poor from 1974 to 2021. -->

<!-- Just ask anyone if they are comfortable -->
